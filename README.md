## Liability-Driven Behavior Framework (LDBF)

### Abstract

The Liability-Driven Behavior Framework is an explicitly axiomatic, descriptive framework for analyzing behavior across individual and institutional contexts. The framework reduces behavioral explanation to utility optimization under liability, horizon, and power constraints rather than moral, normative, or preference-based primitives. Utility is realized only as profit, while power functions as the non-metric capacity to reshape future utility realizability. Behavioral outcomes emerge from horizon-dependent optimization under liability surfaces, not from intent, ethics, or trust.

### 1. Introduction

This paper presents the Liability-Driven Behavior Framework as a compact axiomatic system for behavioral analysis. The framework rejects equilibrium guarantees, ethical primitives, and externally observable preferences. Behavior is modeled as optimization under private horizons, uncertainty, and liability. Stability, cooperation, and institutional persistence are treated as contingent outcomes of enforced alignment rather than equilibrium states. LDBF is not falsified by outcomes that can be explained only by expanding the ontology it intentionally excludes.

### 2. Axioms

**Axiom 1 (Utility, Profit, and Power).**
Utility is the sole scalar objective. Utility is realized only as profit, defined as asset–liability delta. Power is not utility and is not reducible to profit; it is the capacity to determine which profit realizations are possible by reshaping action sets, enforcement, and liability under uncertainty.

**Axiom 2 (Agents and Actors).**
An agent is any system capable of producing a utility delta. An actor is an agent capable of realizing utility and updating strategy. Selection occurs exclusively at the actor level.

**Axiom 3 (Harm).**
Harm is imposed negative utility delta. It has no intrinsic moral status and represents a state transition only.

**Axiom 4 (Time and Horizon).**
Time is variable. Actors operate over private, non-observable horizons. Actions may be locally profitable and globally unprofitable without contradiction.

**Axiom 5 (Liability).**
Liability is expected future negative utility conditional on action. Law, retaliation, reputation, and institutions function as liability mechanisms.

**Axiom 6 (Optimization).**
Actors choose actions that maximize expected discounted utility given realizability, horizon, liability surface, and uncertainty.

**Axiom 7 (Power Accumulation).**
Power is accumulated as insurance against profit decay. Latent power preserves optionality under uncertainty.

**Axiom 8 (Compositions).**
Actors do not merge into a single agent. Institutions are compositions of actors temporarily aligned by incentives. Defection remains continuously available.

**Axiom 9 (Politics).**
Politics is the engineering of power and liability distributions to shape behavior. Psychology is internal politics among competing sub-agents.

**Axiom 10 (Stability and End Game).**
No permanent equilibrium exists. All compositions are temporally stable and degrade toward predation as information spreads and liabilities weaken.

### 3. Propositions

**Proposition 1 (Politics as Anti-Entropic Control).**
From Axioms 5, 7, and 10, unconstrained optimization drives systems toward horizon collapse and utility exhaustion. Politics injects artificial liabilities and redistributes power, delaying convergence to locally optimal but globally terminal states.

**Proposition 2 (Ideal Optimizer Behavior).**
From Axioms 1, 4, and 6, an ideal reductionist actor behaves as if maximizing realizable utility over its effective lifetime horizon, subject to uncertainty and liability constraints.

**Proposition 3 (Promise Impossibility).**
From Axioms 4 and 5, promises have no binding force absent enforceable liability. Observed promise-keeping behavior is reducible to anticipated future utility loss.

**Proposition 4 (Trust as Measurement Error).**
From Axioms 2, 4, and 6, trust is an inference error arising from incomplete horizon and liability estimation, not a property of actors.

**Proposition 6 (Reputation Is Leverage, Not Capital).**
From Axioms 5 and 7, reputation does not store value; it modifies access to future power and liability surfaces.

**Proposition 8 (Fairness as Stability Heuristic).**
From Axioms 6 and 10, fairness norms function as heuristics that delay defection and extend compositional stability rather than enforce equilibrium.

**Proposition 9 (Altruism as Horizon Arbitrage).**
From Axioms 4, 6, and 7, altruism is horizon arbitrage: actors accept immediate loss to alter future liability or power. Horizon termination, including death, does not nullify its effects; induced obligations persist in other actors. Altruism is agency persistence beyond exit.

**Proposition 11 (Markets Do Not Optimize for Welfare).**
From Axioms 1 and 6, markets optimize for realizable utility extraction rather than welfare, except where welfare is explicitly priced into liability.

**Proposition 12 (Stability Is Purchased, Not Achieved).**
From Axioms 5, 7, and 10, stability requires continuous expenditure of power to maintain liability gradients. Absent maintenance, decay is automatic.

**Proposition 13 (God).**
God is dominance named under admitted agency deficit.
Dominance is explicit when power and enforcement are observable. When dominance is non-local, opaque, or absent, God is inferred to explain outcomes beyond the actor’s control. God-invocation marks acknowledgment of insufficient agency relative to the outcome space.

**Proposition 14 (God as Predation Accelerator).**
From Axioms 4, 5, 6, and 10:
When enforcement is weak, delayed, or non-local, God-invocation offloads liability to an inferred dominant agent. This lowers immediate reputational and retaliatory cost, reducing the price of defection and accelerating compositional decay. God-invocation stabilizes behavior only when coupled to real, enforceable liability.

**Proposition 15 (Love as Selection-Enforced Entropy).**
Sexual instinct is a gene-level entropy injection compelling irreversible binding under uncertainty. Agents lacking this distortion exit the selection pool.
Romantic love misrepresents liability acquisition as opportunity, inducing collapse of optionality before outcomes are observable.
Parental love is sunk-cost enforcement that suppresses post-reproduction defection.
Legacy narratives reframe irreversible loss as meaning, stabilizing behavior after hormonal enforcement decays.
Love disables unconstrained optimization. Its persistence reflects selection pressure, not actor-level benefit.

**Proposition 16 (Lineage).**
Lineage is the dead exercising agency through liability.

**Proposition 17 (Pride as Premature Optimization).**
From Axioms 4, 6, and 7.

Pride is the selection of sufficiency over continued optimization.
An actor declares a state “good enough” and halts further search.
This is not error. Optimization has cost. Exploration consumes time, attention, and power. Pride reduces these expenditures by terminating inquiry and stabilizing strategy.
Pride becomes pathological only when it freezes adaptation while the environment continues to drift. In this state:

* marginal optimization is avoided,

* latent liabilities accumulate,
  
* and power decays through obsolescence rather than loss.

Collapse is therefore not caused by pride itself, but by premature convergence under horizon misestimation.

* Pride is efficient under stable conditions and short horizons.
* Pride is fatal under regime change, long horizons, or hidden liability growth.

“Being humbled” is not moral correction. It is delayed feedback from environmental mismatch.

Pride is an optimization heuristic with asymmetric downside:
it saves effort immediately and charges its cost later, often beyond the actor’s ability to respond.

**Proposition 18 (Control Collapse).**

From Axioms 4, 5, and 6:

Control Collapse occurs when an actor’s expected utility recovery time exceeds, or is perceived to exceed, their remaining private horizon, inducing horizon compression and degradation of optimization efficacy.

When expected utility recovery remains feasible within the private horizon, collapse is controlled. The actor preserves horizon coherence and continues comparative optimization, selectively relaxing self-imposed constraints to restore or protect future utility.

When no recovery is feasible within the remaining horizon, collapse is uncontrolled. Horizon compression forces a shift from global to existence-based optimization: the actor abandons comparative maximization and instead pursues any immediately realizable utility. All constraints whose value is realized beyond the remaining horizon—promises, reputation, norms, cooperation, and deferred liability—are liquidated. Behavior converges toward terminal extraction, constraint-blind action, or damage discharge.

The distinction between controlled and uncontrolled collapse is determined solely by the race condition between expected utility recovery time and private horizon termination. Optimization failure under uncontrolled collapse is not a failure of agency or objective, but a structural consequence of horizon compression.

### Annex A — Observability and Failure Conditions

The Liability-Driven Behavior Framework does not assume horizons, utility estimates, or liability surfaces are externally observable. Individual actions are not directly falsifiable.

Falsifiability applies at the distributional level.

From Axioms 4, 5, 6, and 10, the following must hold:

* Increasing enforcement reduces defection and displaces trust, moral, and theological coordination.
* Decreasing liability observability increases God-invocation and fatalistic attribution.
* Increasing horizon uncertainty increases short-horizon extraction and predation.

Failure of these monotonic relationships requires revision of the axioms.
If stable cooperation persists under high uncertainty without enforceable liability or reputational carryover, the framework is false.

### Annex B — Composition Criterion

A set of actors constitutes a composition if and only if alignment is sustained by at least one of:

(a) **Power asymmetry** — leverage enabling enforcement.
(b) **Enforceable liability** — credible future cost for defection.
(c) **Horizon differential** — asymmetric time preference enabling control.

Absent all three, alignment is unstable and interactions are transient.

### 4. Conclusion

The Liability-Driven Behavior Framework reframes behavioral analysis by eliminating moral intent, trust, and equilibrium as explanatory primitives. Stability, cooperation, and institutional persistence arise from temporary alignment enforced by liability and power, not from shared values or norms. Collapse, predation, and betrayal are predictable outcomes once horizons shorten or liabilities weaken. The framework does not predict behavior; it constrains explanation. What remains after applying it is not what behavior ought to be, but what behavior can be.
